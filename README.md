# GameBox

GAMEBOX is a service updated frequently for all your 'basic' gaming needs.

Just run 'main.py' to start the service.

Indivdual files are coded within the main file and cannot be used on their own.

The files in the TESTING folder are test files. You may use them within the project and they are being worked on to be integrated inside.

You may reuse any of the files in this project in your own work as long as nessecary credit is given (i.e. Labeling me in the start of the app or in the README file.)
